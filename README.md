# Etch-a-Sketch
## On this site you are able to sketch whetever you want with you mouse.
### At the start we get 16x16 grid of squares. 
### Whenever you mouseover on one the squares, the color changes to a random one.
Moving again on already colored square will cause it to go darker.
Hovering the same square over, and over again, will make it full dark after some time.

## You can make your grid to a maximum of 100 x 100, but setting larger than 64 x 64 is not recommended.
